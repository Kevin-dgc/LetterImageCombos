# LetterImageCombos

* run the program with the ./run and then type in any combos of letters A-Z, a-z, 0-9 (any other char's will be discarded untill supported)
* and the program will create an image with all letters on top of themeselfs


# Note

* lodepng.cpp and lodepng.hpp are not my code [link to gitrepo](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng)
* letter fonts ideas from [levi-szekeres](https://www.dafont.com/leviwindows.font?fpp=50&l[]=6), but bitmaps of letters made by me
